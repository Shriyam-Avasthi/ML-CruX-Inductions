# CRUx ML Inductions Submission Repository
## Task 1: Scikit-Learn Classification Algorithms
1. Used the Titanic dataset and carried out data preprocessing (missing value handling, categorical variables) for the features.
2. Performed EDA on the data using any visualization library of your choice (Plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
3. Performed simple classification using the following models:
    Logistic Regression
    Support Vector Machines
    Linear Discriminant Analysis
    XGBoost
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
4. Read up on the theory behind all of these algorithms
5. Used GridSearch to tune the hyperparameters in each case.
6. Implemented the Logistic Regression model from scratch (using only NumPy and Pandas)

## Task 2: Colourization of Black & White Images using CNNs
1. Read the underlying theory behind CNNs.
2. Used Tensorflow to build and train a DL model.
3. Used the given kaggle dataset for the grayscale and coloured images.
4. Read up on encoder-decoder architecture for image colourization and implemented it.
5. Used callbacks to prevent the modelâ€™s validation loss from increasing during training. Added model checkpointing as well.
6. Used graphing libraries to plot accuracy/loss during training.

## Task 3: Image Classification using MediaPipe 
1. Used the MediaPipe Image embedding feature to convert the images from the dataset into embedding vectors.
2. Used MiniBatchKMeans clustering algorithm to classify the embeddings. Learnt the theory behind this algorithm.
3. Used cosine similarity function to evaluate the distance between embeddings.
4. Wrote a function that classifies all the images in the test dataset and plots them on a 2D scatter plot showing the cluster each image belongs to.
